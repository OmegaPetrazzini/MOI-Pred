# MOI-Pred

MOI-Pred (Mode Of Inheritance-Predictor) is a three-way variant-level mode of inheritance prediction tool that specifically tackles recessive identification of missense variants.

MOI-Pred uses a random forest model to predict variants pathogenic for autosomal recessive (AR) disease, pathogenic for autosomal dominant (AD) disease, or benign. The model learns from 78 functional, evolutionary and population frequency annotations.

We provide pre-computed MOI-Pred predictions for 71M missense variants in the human genome, please use: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5565247

Details about MOI-Pred, including the methods, features and performance assessment are described in our manuscript: BO Petrazzini, DJ Balick, IS Forrest, J Cho, G Rocheleau, DM Jordan*, R Do*. Prediction of recessive inheritance for missense variants in human disease. Submitted.
